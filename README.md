# ***About This Project***
     This project is about taking an api and using MongoDb to execute building schemas with noSql. When the schema is succesfully executed, then new registering id's are given to each of request in the api.

## ***Aplication Use***
    Users are able to store their thoughts in unique ids and be able to interact with other users. This compares to a social website but with minimal functionality. This is for people to gather and post things to a message board like a town hall and socially connect.

## ***User Story***
    AS A social media startup
    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## ***Acceptance Criteria***
    GIVEN a social network API
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
